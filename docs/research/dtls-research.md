## 1. Executive Summary

This document summarizes the research, evaluation, and final architectural decision for securing the network communication of the Space Captain project. The primary challenge was to select a security protocol that could protect our custom UDP-based transport layer without compromising the low-latency, high-throughput, and loss-tolerant nature required for a real-time multiplayer game.

The selected solution is to implement **DTLS 1.3**, leveraging a flexible wrapper interface that will initially use the **Mbed TLS** library. This approach provides robust security, high performance, and the architectural freedom to adapt in the future. Authentication will be handled via **certificate pinning** to ensure security without relying on a complex public CA infrastructure.

## 2. Problem Statement

The networking layer for Space Captain (v0.1.0) is built on UDP to achieve the performance necessary for a fast-paced MMO. Standard UDP provides no security, leaving the game vulnerable to common attacks such as:

*   **Eavesdropping:** Sniffing packets to steal game state information.
*   **Packet Injection/Spoofing:** Malicious clients sending fake packets.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker intercepting and modifying traffic between the client and server.

A security solution was required that met the following criteria:
1.  Preserves the low-latency benefits of UDP.
2.  Tolerates packet loss and reordering.
3.  Provides strong, modern encryption, authentication, and integrity.
4.  Is performant enough for a high-speed game server and a wide range of client hardware.
5.  Supports cross-platform compilation for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## 3. Protocol Evaluation: Why DTLS?

Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) was identified as the industry-standard solution. It is a variant of the widely-used TLS protocol, adapted specifically for datagram-based transports like UDP.

*   **Handles Unreliability:** DTLS incorporates mechanisms to manage packet loss, reordering, and fragmentation, which are fatal to standard TLS.
*   **Session-Based Security:** It establishes a secure, long-lived session via an initial handshake, after which application data can be exchanged with low overhead.
*   **Proven Security Model:** It provides the same core security guarantees as TLS: confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

Given these characteristics, DTLS was deemed the ideal protocol for our use case.

## 4. Library Evaluation

Three prominent C libraries were evaluated for implementing DTLS:

| Library      | Key Strengths                                                              | Weaknesses                                                              | Licensing             |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Mbed TLS** | Excellent documentation, clean/modern API, easy to use, permissive license. | Slightly larger footprint than wolfSSL.                                 | Apache 2.0            |
| **wolfSSL**  | High performance, small footprint, strong commercial support options.      | More complex API, GPLv3 license requires a paid license for closed-source projects. | GPLv3 or Commercial   |
| **GnuTLS**   | Feature-rich, strong on Linux, LGPL license is good for closed-source.     | **Poor cross-platform support**, especially on Windows. Complex API.    | LGPLv2.1+             |

### Decision: A Wrapper-Based Approach with Mbed TLS

For the initial implementation, **Mbed TLS** was selected due to its ease of use, excellent documentation, and permissive license, which will accelerate initial development.

However, to avoid vendor lock-in and retain maximum flexibility, the architecture mandates a **security abstraction layer**. This wrapper will provide a simple, unified interface for all security operations (handshake, read, write, etc.). The core application will only interact with this wrapper. This design allows us to switch to another library like wolfSSL in the future by simply implementing a new backend for the wrapper and changing a compile-time flag.

## 5. Selected Security Architecture

The final security architecture for Space Captain v0.1.0 is as follows:

*   **Protocol:** DTLS 1.3 will be used to secure all client-server UDP traffic.
*   **Library:** Mbed TLS will be the first library implemented via the security wrapper.
*   **Cipher Suites:** The connection will be configured to use high-performance, modern authenticated encryption (AEAD) ciphers, such as `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` or `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`. Since security only needs to last for the duration of a game session, these provide an optimal balance of speed and strength.
*   **Authentication:** **Certificate Pinning** will be used. The server will use a self-signed certificate, and the client will be distributed with a hash of this certificate's public key. During the handshake, the client will verify the server's identity against this pinned hash, providing strong protection against MITM attacks without the overhead of a traditional CA system.
*   **Connection Flow:** The DTLS handshake will replace the previous custom handshake. A successful handshake establishes a valid, secure session, after which encrypted game data can be exchanged.
