# Space Captain Research Documentation

This directory contains research papers, speculative designs, and exploratory documentation for the Space Captain project. These documents do not need to be updated when code changes and may contain ideas that haven't been implemented yet.

## Research Papers

### Architecture & Scalability
- [Net-Worker Pool Architecture](net-worker-pool-architecture.md) - A 3-tier server model for extreme I/O scalability and simplified rebalancing
- [MMO Architecture Research](mmo-architecture-research.md) - High-level architecture patterns and design considerations for MMO systems
- [MMO State Management and Protocols](mmo-state-management-protocols.md) - Technical white paper on MMO global state management and client-server protocols
- [Balanced Continuous Graph Partition Problem](balanced-continous-graph-partition-problem.md) - Research on graph partitioning algorithms for distributed game state

### Security & Networking
- [DTLS for Real-Time Game Traffic](dtls-research.md) - Research summary on securing UDP with DTLS and selecting a crypto library
- [Authenticated Messages over UDP](authenticated-messages-over-udp.md) - Security considerations for UDP-based game protocols
- [Mbed TLS Integration Research](mbed-tls-research.md) - Analysis of integrating mbed-tls library for TLS encryption with certificate pinning
- [OpenSSL Integration Research](openssl-research.md) - Analysis of integrating OpenSSL for TLS encryption with certificate pinning
- [OIDC Authentication Research](oidc-for-cli-research.md) - OAuth 2.0 + OIDC authentication integration for CLI clients

### Monitoring & Observability
- [Monitoring with Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus](grafana-loki-prometheus-stack.md) - Research on a recommended monitoring stack for the server and client fleet.

### User Interface
- [NCurses Research](ncurses-research.md) - Comprehensive guide to NCurses for terminal UI development

## About Research Documents

These documents may include:
- Exploration of technologies not yet integrated
- Speculative designs for future features
- Analysis of different implementation approaches
- Research into industry best practices
- Proof-of-concept ideas

Research documents are valuable for understanding the project's evolution and potential future directions, but they should not be considered current documentation of implemented features.
