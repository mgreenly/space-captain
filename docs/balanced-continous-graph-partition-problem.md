Excellent question. This is a classic and challenging problem that sits at the intersection of computational geometry, load balancing, and parallel computing. It's a type of **balanced, contiguous graph partitioning problem**. In general, this problem is NP-hard, meaning there's no known algorithm that can find the absolute perfect solution efficiently for all possible inputs. However, there are excellent and widely-used heuristic algorithms that provide very good solutions very quickly.

Let's break down the problem parameters first:
*   **Coordinate Space:** 1,000,000 x 1,000,000
*   **Cell Grid:** 100 x 100 = 10,000 cells
*   **Objects:** 5,000
*   **Actors:** 25
*   **Target Load per Actor:** 5,000 objects / 25 actors = **200 objects**
*   **Primary Goal:** Each actor's assigned cells must contain a total of 200 objects (or as close as possible).
*   **Constraint:** For each actor, the set of assigned cells must be a single, continuous region (i.e., you can travel from any cell in the set to any other cell in the set by moving between adjacent—sharing an edge—cells).
*   **Dynamic Requirement:** The solution must be fast to re-calculate as objects move.

### Are there existing algorithms to solve this?

Yes. The most effective and commonly used algorithms for this kind of spatial decomposition fall into a few families. I'll describe the most suitable one in detail and mention others for context.

The best-fit algorithm for your use case is **Space-Filling Curve (SFC) Partitioning**.

### Recommended Algorithm: Space-Filling Curve (SFC) Partitioning

This technique is powerful because it cleverly transforms your 2D problem into a much simpler 1D problem, while mostly preserving the spatial relationships (contiguity).

#### 1. The Concept

A space-filling curve is a line that passes through every single cell in a grid without crossing itself. The key property is **locality preservation**: cells that are close to each other in 2D space are also likely to be close to each other along the 1D curve. The **Hilbert Curve** is generally considered the best for this purpose due to its superior locality properties compared to others like the Z-order (Morton) curve.

#### 2. The Algorithm Steps

The process is remarkably efficient and elegant:

**Step 1: Pre-computation (One-time setup)**
*   Generate the Hilbert Curve path for your 100x100 grid. This means assigning a unique index from 0 to 9,999 to each cell based on its position along the curve. This mapping is static and never changes. You can store this as a lookup table: `cell_coords -> hilbert_index`.

**Step 2: Load Calculation (Repeated for each update)**
*   For each of the 10,000 cells, count how many of the 5,000 objects fall within its boundaries. Let's call this `object_count[cell]`. This is your "weight" for each cell.

**Step 3: 1D Partitioning (Repeated for each update)**
*   Create a simple, 1D list of all 10,000 cells, ordered by their Hilbert Curve index (from 0 to 9,999).
*   Your target load is 200 objects per actor.
*   Iterate through this ordered list, assigning cells to Actor 1 and summing their object counts.
*   Once the cumulative object count for Actor 1 meets or exceeds 200, you stop assigning cells to Actor 1 and start assigning the next cells to Actor 2.
*   Repeat this process for all 25 actors until all cells are assigned.

**Example Walkthrough:**
1.  `current_actor = 1`, `current_load = 0`, `target_load = 200`
2.  Get the cell with Hilbert index 0. Say it has 5 objects. Assign it to Actor 1. `current_load` becomes 5.
3.  Get the cell with Hilbert index 1. Say it has 3 objects. Assign it to Actor 1. `current_load` becomes 8.
4.  ... continue this ...
5.  Get the cell with Hilbert index `k`. It has 10 objects. The `current_load` is 195. After assigning this cell, the load becomes 205.
6.  Since `205 >= 200`, you are done with Actor 1. You assign this entire cell to Actor 1. The partition is now complete.
7.  Start the process over for Actor 2 with the cell at Hilbert index `k+1`.

#### 3. Why is this a good solution?

*   **Excellent Load Balancing:** This method naturally produces partitions that are as close to the target load as possible. The balance is only imperfect by the object count of the single cell that straddles the boundary, which is unavoidable in any cell-based method.
*   **High Probability of Contiguity:** Because the Hilbert curve preserves locality so well, a contiguous segment of the 1D list almost always corresponds to a single, contiguous 2D region of cells. It's not a mathematical *guarantee*, but in practice, it works exceptionally well and failures are rare and minor. If perfect contiguity is an absolute must, a small post-processing "stitching" step can be added to fix any minor disconnected components, usually by trading a boundary cell with a neighbor.
*   **Extreme Efficiency for Updates:** This is the killer feature for your use case.
    *   The Hilbert curve mapping (Step 1) is done once.
    *   When objects move, you only need to re-run the fast parts: recounting objects in cells (Step 2) and iterating through the 1D list (Step 3).
    *   Step 3 is a single pass over a list of 10,000 elements, which is computationally trivial for a modern computer. This makes re-partitioning almost instantaneous.

### Alternative Algorithms (and why they are less suitable)

#### 1. Recursive Bisection (Quadtree-based approach)

*   **How it works:** Start with the whole grid. Find a vertical or horizontal line to cut the grid into two pieces, trying to split the total object load according to how many actors you'll assign to each piece (e.g., split 25 actors into groups of 12 and 13, and try to split the 5000 objects into corresponding loads of 2400 and 2600). Then, recursively apply this process to the sub-regions until you have 25 final regions.
*   **Pros:** Guarantees contiguity and often produces simple, rectangular-like partitions.
*   **Cons:** **Poor load balancing.** It is very difficult to find a cut that exactly achieves the desired load split. The errors accumulate at each level of the recursion, leading to final partitions that can be far from the target load of 200. Updates are also more complex to implement efficiently.

#### 2. Greedy Region Growing

*   **How it works:** Place 25 "seed" cells on the grid (one for each actor). Then, in rounds, each actor's region expands by claiming an adjacent, unassigned cell. An actor stops claiming cells once its target load is met.
*   **Pros:** Guarantees contiguity.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Highly sensitive to seed placement.** Bad seeds can lead to terrible partitions.
    *   **Can get "stuck."** A region can be surrounded by others before it reaches its target load, leaving no way to grow.
    *   The process can result in highly irregular and inefficient "gerrymandered" shapes.
    *   Achieving a perfect balance is very difficult.

### Final Recommendation and Summary

For your problem, the **Space-Filling Curve (SFC) Partitioning method using a Hilbert Curve is the superior choice.**

*   **It directly addresses your primary goals:** It achieves near-perfect load balancing while maintaining spatial contiguity in almost all cases.
*   **It is designed for your dynamic requirement:** The re-calculation step is extremely fast and efficient, making it ideal for situations where objects are constantly moving and the partitions need frequent updates.

**To implement it, you would need:**
1.  A library or function to generate Hilbert curve indices for a 2D grid. These are widely available in many programming languages.
2.  Logic to count objects per cell.
3.  A simple loop to perform the 1D partitioning as described above.
