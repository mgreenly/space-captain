# Space Captain Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans that break down the Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into actionable, testable development steps.

## Purpose

While PRDs define **what** will be built, implementation plans define **how** it will be built. These plans:

- Break down high-level requirements into concrete development tasks
- Define the order of implementation to minimize risk and maximize learning
- Integrate testing infrastructure at each phase of development
- Provide specific technical approaches and code examples
- Ensure measurable progress through testable milestones

## Available Plans

There are currently no active implementation plans. New plans will be added here as they are developed.

## Plan Structure

Each implementation plan follows this structure:

1. **Key Principles** - Core technical decisions and approaches
2. **Development Phases** - Logical grouping of related tasks
3. **Build Steps** - Specific implementation tasks in order
4. **Test Infrastructure** - Testing tools and approaches for each phase
5. **Testing Focus** - What to validate before moving forward
6. **Code Examples** - Concrete examples of testing approaches
7. **Success Metrics** - How to measure completion

## Relationship to PRDs

Each plan corresponds to a PRD in the `prds/` directory:

- PRD: Defines features, goals, and success criteria
- Plan: Defines implementation steps, testing strategy, and technical approach

## Creating New Plans

When creating a new implementation plan:

1. Name it `plan-X.Y.Z.md` matching the PRD version
2. Start from the PRD requirements and work backwards
3. Focus on testable, incremental progress
4. Include specific testing infrastructure at each phase
5. Provide code examples where helpful
6. Update this README with a summary

## Testing Philosophy

All plans emphasize building testing infrastructure alongside features:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Test harnesses are separate from production code
- **Early Testing**: Each phase includes tests before moving forward
- **Negative Testing**: Explicitly test error cases and malformed inputs
- **Performance Testing**: Validate scalability requirements throughout development
- **Automated Testing**: Prefer automated tests over manual verification

The plans use Ruby for testing infrastructure, leveraging its excellent networking libraries and scripting capabilities to create sophisticated test scenarios quickly.
