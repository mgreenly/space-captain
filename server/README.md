Space Captain
=============

What is this?  It's a learning project centered around building a online multi-player game that can best be described
as a blend of Eve Online and Dwarf Fortress with a sprinkling of Factorio presented via a text-based interface.

Be forewarned this is more about learning "C" and Linux programming than actually developing a game.
