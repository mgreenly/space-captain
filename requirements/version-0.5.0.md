# Version 0.5.0 Requirements - Windows Graphical Client

**Status**: SPECULATIVE - Subject to change
**Target Release**: 2026 Q3 (July - September 2026)
**Theme**: Windows Platform Support

## Overview

Version 0.5.0 completes the cross-platform graphical client trilogy by adding Windows support. This release provides a native Windows experience while maintaining feature parity with Linux and MacOS clients.

## Goals

1. Native Windows graphical client
2. Feature parity with Linux and MacOS clients
3. Windows-specific optimizations
4. Complete cross-platform support

## Features

### Windows Client
- [ ] Windows executable (.exe)
- [ ] Windows installer (MSI or similar)
- [ ] DirectX 11+ graphics API support
- [ ] DirectX 11 baseline with DirectX 12 optimizations
- [ ] Windows 10/11 specific features

### Platform Integration
- [ ] Windows taskbar integration
- [ ] Native Windows controls where appropriate
- [ ] TODO: Windows notification system
- [ ] TODO: Xbox controller support

### Cross-Platform Completion
- [ ] Unified codebase with platform-specific rendering
- [ ] Abstract rendering interface supporting Vulkan/Metal/DirectX
- [ ] Consistent user experience across all platforms
- [ ] Cross-platform build automation for all three targets

### Packaging and Distribution
- [ ] MSI installer package creation
- [ ] Code signing with certificate for security
- [ ] WinGet manifest creation and submission
- [ ] Automated WinGet package updates
- [ ] Windows Defender SmartScreen approval process
- [ ] Distribution exclusively through WinGet

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Support
- Windows 10 version 1909 or later
- Windows 11 support
- TODO: 32-bit vs 64-bit considerations

### Dependencies
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- Windows SDK with DirectX 11+ support
- DirectX runtime redistribution
- MSVC runtime libraries

### Performance Targets
- DirectX 11 baseline performance
- DirectX 12 optimizations where available
- TODO: Windows Defender compatibility
- TODO: Anti-cheat considerations

## Testing Requirements

### Platform Testing
- [ ] Windows 10 compatibility
- [ ] Windows 11 compatibility
- [ ] Various hardware configurations
- [ ] TODO: Windows-specific edge cases

### Distribution Testing
- [ ] MSI installer functionality verification
- [ ] WinGet installation and update testing
- [ ] Code signing validation
- [ ] SmartScreen reputation testing

## Migration Path

### Compatibility
- Server remains unchanged from 0.4.0
- Network protocol compatibility maintained
- Linux and MacOS clients continue to function

### Documentation
- [ ] Windows client installation guide
- [ ] Windows-specific troubleshooting
- [ ] TODO: Complete cross-platform guide

## Success Criteria

1. Windows users have full game access
2. Performance comparable to other platforms
3. TODO: Windows certification requirements
4. TODO: User adoption metrics

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Windows Development Complexity**: Multiple DirectX versions
   - Mitigation: Target DirectX 11 as baseline, add 12 features progressively
2. **Anti-Virus False Positives**: TODO
3. **DirectX Version Compatibility**: Balancing features vs compatibility
   - Mitigation: DirectX 11 minimum ensures broad hardware support

## Future Considerations

With all major platforms supported, focus can shift to gameplay features in 0.6.0.
