# Version 0.2.0 Requirements - TLS Security and Cross-Platform Support

**Status**: PLANNED
**Target Release**: 2025 Q4 (October - December 2025)
**Theme**: Security Foundation and Platform Portability

## Overview

Version 0.2.0 establishes critical security infrastructure and cross-platform support for the Space Captain project. This release focuses on implementing TLS encryption for all client-server communications and ensuring the CLI client builds and runs correctly on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

## Goals

1. Implement TLS encryption for all network communications
2. Establish cross-platform build system
3. Ensure CLI client works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
4. Create foundation for secure, portable game infrastructure

## Features

### TLS Implementation
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ support for all client-server connections
- [ ] Self-signed certificate generation and management
- [ ] Certificate validation options for development/production
- [ ] Encrypted message protocol over TLS
- [ ] Performance optimization for encrypted connections

### Cross-Platform Build System
- [ ] Cross-platform build system for all platforms
- [ ] Platform-specific networking abstraction layer
- [ ] Unified dependency management
- [ ] Automated build testing on all platforms
- [ ] Cross-compilation support

### Linux Support (Enhanced)
- [ ] Native epoll support maintained for server
- [ ] TLS integration with existing epoll architecture
- [ ] Package build scripts for major distributions
- [ ] Systemd service files for server deployment

### macOS Support
- [ ] kqueue-based event handling for server
- [ ] Native macOS socket implementation
- [ ] Homebrew formula for easy installation
- [ ] macOS keychain integration for certificates (optional)

### Windows Support
- [ ] Windows socket (Winsock2) implementation
- [ ] IOCP or select-based event handling for server
- [ ] Visual Studio and MinGW build support
- [ ] Windows service wrapper for server deployment
- [ ] MSI installer for client distribution

### Client Settings Persistence (Cross-Platform)
- [ ] Unified settings format across all platforms
- [ ] Platform-specific storage locations:
  - Linux: ~/.spacecaptain/config
  - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/SpaceCaptain/
  - Windows: %APPDATA%\SpaceCaptain\
- [ ] Settings migration from 0.1.0 format
- [ ] TLS certificate preferences
- [ ] Server connection history with encryption

### Security Infrastructure
- [ ] Certificate generation utilities
- [ ] Certificate management documentation
- [ ] Security best practices guide
- [ ] Performance impact analysis of TLS

## Technical Requirements

### TLS Library Selection
- Primary option: OpenSSL (broad platform support)
- Alternative option: mbed TLS (smaller footprint)
- Platform-specific options documented
- Library abstraction layer for future flexibility

### Platform Requirements

#### Linux
- GCC 9+ or Clang 10+
- Build tools (Make)
- OpenSSL 1.1.1+ or mbed TLS 2.16+
- glibc 2.31+ (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS baseline)

#### macOS
- macOS 11.0+ (Big Sur)
- Xcode 12+ or Command Line Tools
- Build tools
- OpenSSL via Homebrew (not system LibreSSL)

#### Windows
- Windows 10 version 1909+
- Visual Studio 2019+ or MinGW-w64
- Build tools
- OpenSSL or mbed TLS binaries

### Network Protocol Updates
- [ ] TLS handshake integration with connection establishment
- [ ] Encrypted message framing
- [ ] Backward compatibility plan for non-TLS connections (development only)
- [ ] Connection upgrade path from non-TLS to TLS

## Testing Requirements

### Security Testing
- [ ] TLS configuration validation
- [ ] Certificate verification tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks with TLS enabled
- [ ] Penetration testing guidelines

### Platform Testing
- [ ] Automated builds on Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
- [ ] Automated builds on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Automated builds on Windows (MSVC and MinGW)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing
- [ ] Network protocol compatibility across platforms

### Performance Testing
- [ ] TLS overhead measurement
- [ ] Platform-specific optimization validation
- [ ] Concurrent connection testing with TLS
- [ ] Memory usage analysis per platform

## Migration Path

### Compatibility
- Version 0.1.0 clients can connect to 0.2.0 servers (with warning)
- Configuration option to disable TLS (development only)
- Clear deprecation timeline for non-TLS connections

### Documentation
- [ ] TLS setup and configuration guide
- [ ] Platform-specific build instructions
- [ ] Certificate management procedures
- [ ] Security best practices
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide per platform

## Success Criteria

1. All client-server communications encrypted with TLS
2. CLI client builds and runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows
3. No significant performance degradation from TLS
4. Automated CI/CD pipeline for all platforms
5. Security audit passed

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **TLS Performance Impact**: May affect server capacity
   - Mitigation: Implement session resumption, optimize cipher suites
   
2. **Platform-Specific Bugs**: Different behavior across OSes
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive platform abstraction layer
   
3. **Certificate Management Complexity**: Self-signed certs add complexity
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation, automated tooling
   
4. **Build System Complexity**: Cross-platform builds can be challenging
   - Mitigation: Well-documented build process, pre-built binaries for testing

## Future Considerations

This release establishes the security and portability foundation necessary for the graphical clients planned in versions 0.3.0+ and the eventual move to production deployment.
