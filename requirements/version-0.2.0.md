# Version 0.2.0 Requirements - Linux Graphical Client

**Status**: SPECULATIVE - Subject to change
**Target Release**: 2025 Q4 (October - December 2025)
**Theme**: Graphical User Interface for Linux

## Overview

Version 0.2.0 focuses exclusively on creating a graphical client for Linux systems. This release will not introduce any new gameplay features but will provide a visual interface that maintains feature parity with the 0.1.0 CLI/ncurses client.

## Goals

1. Create a native Linux graphical client
2. Maintain feature parity with the CLI version
3. Provide an intuitive visual interface for space combat
4. Preserve the captain command REPL experience

## Features

### Graphical Client Foundation
- [ ] Graphics framework selection and integration (TODO: Specify framework)
- [ ] Window management and display initialization
- [ ] Event handling system for user input
- [ ] Rendering pipeline for 2D space visualization

### Visual Components
- [ ] Space view showing ship positions and movements
- [ ] Contact list display panel
- [ ] Target information panel
- [ ] Power distribution visualization (shields, drives, cloaks)
- [ ] Command REPL interface with history

### User Interface
- [ ] Main game window layout
- [ ] HUD elements for critical information
- [ ] Visual feedback for commands
- [ ] TODO: Specific UI mockups and design specifications

### Client Architecture
- [ ] Separation of rendering from game logic
- [ ] Integration with existing network protocol
- [ ] Performance optimization for smooth rendering
- [ ] TODO: Target frame rate and performance metrics

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Support
- Linux x86_64
- TODO: Specific distributions to support
- TODO: Minimum system requirements

### Dependencies
- TODO: Graphics library (SDL2, Raylib, etc.)
- TODO: UI framework requirements
- TODO: Build system updates

### Performance Targets
- TODO: Target FPS
- TODO: Memory usage limits
- TODO: Network bandwidth constraints

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing
- [ ] All CLI features accessible via GUI
- [ ] Command REPL functionality preserved
- [ ] Network communication compatibility
- [ ] TODO: Automated GUI testing approach

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Rendering performance benchmarks
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Network latency impact
- [ ] TODO: Specific performance test scenarios

## Migration Path

### Compatibility
- Server remains unchanged from 0.1.0
- Network protocol compatibility maintained
- CLI client continues to function

### Documentation
- [ ] GUI client user guide
- [ ] Installation instructions for Linux
- [ ] TODO: Video tutorials or screenshots

## Success Criteria

1. Linux users can connect to servers using the graphical client
2. All features from the CLI version are accessible
3. Performance meets minimum requirements
4. TODO: User acceptance testing criteria

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Graphics Framework Selection**: TODO - Evaluate options
2. **Performance on Low-End Hardware**: TODO - Define minimum specs
3. **UI/UX Design Complexity**: TODO - Create mockups early

## Future Considerations

This release establishes the foundation for graphical clients on other platforms (MacOS in 0.3.0, Windows in 0.4.0).
