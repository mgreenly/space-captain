# Version 0.6.0 PRD - Persistent World Foundation

**Status**: SPECULATIVE - Subject to change
**Target Release**: 2026 Q4 (October - December 2026)
**Theme**: Transition from Combat Sim to Persistent MMO

## Overview

Version 0.6.0 marks a fundamental shift from a session-based space combat simulator to a persistent world MMO. This release introduces minimal viable versions of core MMO systems: crew progression, economy, technology progression, resource gathering, and manufacturing.

## Goals

1. Implement persistent player data
2. Introduce progression systems
3. Create basic economic gameplay loops
4. Establish foundation for long-term player engagement

## Features

### Persistence Layer
- [ ] Player account system
- [ ] Persistent ship state
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] TODO: Save/load architecture

### Crew Progression (Minimal)
- [ ] Basic crew member attributes
- [ ] Simple experience/skill system
- [ ] Crew performance impacts
- [ ] TODO: Progression mechanics

### Economy System (Minimal)
- [ ] Basic currency (credits)
- [ ] Simple trading between players
- [ ] NPC vendors (basic)
- [ ] TODO: Economic balance

### Technology Progression (Minimal)
- [ ] Basic tech tree
- [ ] Simple upgrade paths
- [ ] Research mechanics
- [ ] TODO: Tech tree design

### Resource Gathering (Minimal)
