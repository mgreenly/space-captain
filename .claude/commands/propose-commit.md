Analyze the current git changes and propose a well-structured commit message following these guidelines:

1. First line: A concise summary (50 chars or less) using imperative mood (e.g., "fix", "add", "update")
2. Optional body: If needed, add a blank line followed by more detailed explanation (wrap at 72 chars)
3. Focus on WHY the change was made, not just WHAT changed
4. Check the repository's recent commit history to match the existing style and conventions

At the end of the commit message, add a co-authored-by attribution:
Co-authored-by: Claude (model-name)

Replace "model-name" with your current model identifier.
